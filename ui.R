One can clearly observe that States that have higher poverty rates, tend to have much higher Obesity rates compared to States that have much lower poverty rates. Take Utah and West Virgina: Utah has an extremely low poverty rate AND an extremely low obesity rate. However, if you observe the State where over 15.5% of their population lives below the poverty line, West Virginia, you also observe that over 40% of their population is considered obese. It's also important to recognize the outliers such as Nebraska, Wisconsin,Minnesota, that have very high rates of obesity but relatively low rates of poverty. It's important to question if there are other factors that contribute to obesity rather than just poverty. For example, we could analyze these states against number of fast food restaurant within a 10 mile radius. Or perhaps we could analyze weather patterns in these States to compare cold weather to Obesity rates. Regardless of the outliers and multitude of possible explanations for Obesity rates in the USA, this data shows a high correlation between poverty rates and obesity percentages."),

The interplay between obesity and poverty is rooted in various factors, including access to healthy foods, education levels, physical activity levels, and living environments. Lower-income communities often face greater challenges in accessing nutritious food options, contributing to higher rates of obesity. Moreover, our data analysis showed that these lower income communities often have limited access to safe spaces for physical activity, further compounding the issue of obesity in low income areas. We also wanted to analyze how the time has impacted the correlation between obesity and poverty. Taking to consideration of COVID-19, lockdowns and social distancing measures led to reduced physical activity and decrease in overall net income per family. Economic hardships intensified by the pandemic, especially in already low income communities, have made it much harder for people living in poverty to afford healthy food options or access fitness facilities. However, it looks like there was little to no correlation between time and obesity rates. State-by-State analysis also revealed that low physical activity rates are closely linked with higher obesity and poverty rates. States with lower socioeconomic status often report less access to recreational facilities, increasing the number of people per state who perform zero leisure physical activity. This relationship underscores the importance of public health strategies and policies that aim to increase physical activity levels across all socioeconomic levels."),

However, even with the data present here, it is easy to draw the conclusion that there is a very serious epidemic in the United States in regards to health, obesity, and poverty. The years of 2018-2022 have shed light on the intricate relationship between obesity and poverty, with the COVID-19 pandemic playing a significant role in exacerbating these issues. Although we have highlighted a correlation between poverty, obesity, and lack of physical activity, it's important to address that obesity is a highly complex issue that is multifaceted by American culture, diet fads, mental health, healthcare access, and much more. Public health interventions must be tailored to address the specific needs of dispared communities that aren't given equitable access to resources that promote healthy lifestyles and combat the cycle of obesity and poverty."),
