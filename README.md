# Introduction
**Project Overview:** Exploring the Dynamics of Poverty and Obesity in the United States

This project investigates the relationship between poverty/wealth and obesity in the United States. Through analysis of combined data from Nutrition, Physical Activity, and Obesity Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System provided by the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services and National Obesity by State published by the CDC, we aim to shed light on several critical questions surrounding this topic.

**Key Questions:**
Correlation Between Poverty and Obesity: We seek to understand the strength of the correlation between poverty and obesity nationwide. Additionally, we explore the variance in this relationship varies across different states.

**Impact of the Pandemic:** How has the relationship between poverty and obesity rates evolved from 2020 during the pandemic to 2022, after the pandemic? This inquiry delves into the potential effects of the pandemic on these societal issues.

**Causal Pathway and Barriers to Physical Activity:** Is there a causal pathway linking poverty to reduced leisure physical activity and increased obesity rates? We will examine potential barriers to physical activity in low-income areas or states, such as lack of access to recreational spaces or job constraints.

**Data Sources and Ethical Considerations**
Our analysis takes data from the Nutrition, Physical Activity, and Obesity Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System provided by the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services and the National Obesity by State dataset published by the CDC. While these datasets offer valuable insights, it is crucial to acknowledge potential ethical questions and limitations. Issues such as data privacy, biases inherent in survey data collection, and representativeness of the sample are a few issues to think about. 



# Conclusion / Summary Takeaways
We initially sought to answer the following questions:
   What is the correlation between poverty and obesity in the United States?
   What kind of impact did the pandemic have on the relationship between obesity and poverty?
   Are there casual pathways and barreirs to physical activity that link poverty to reduced physical activity?
                  
Our critical research questions aimed to identify:
   A correlation between poverty and obesity in the United States
   How the years 2018-2022, and the COVID-19 pandemic, affected low-income communities and what affect, if any, that had on Obesity rates in those areas
   How the lack of access to fitness facilities impacts obesity rates
                  
                  
Specific Takeaways:
   West Virginia has the highest obesity rate (40.3% of their population classified as Obese) and 15.3% of their population lives below the poverty line
   New Mexico has the highest poverty rate (18.3% of their population classified as under the poverty level) and 25.7% of their population is considered Obese
    Mississipi has the highest level of people who perform little to no physical activity (31.2% of their population) and 34.8% of their population is considered obese (17.8% of their population lives below the poverty line
     The greatest change in average obesity levels from 2018 to 2022 is between 2018 to 2019
     The greatest change in average obesity levels from 2018 to 2022 is between 2018 to 2019. The average obesity rate is around 31.56% across the 4 years.

Insights:
     Insights from our research into the affect that Poverty has on Obesity is that besides a few outliers, it is very clear that high obestiy rates can be closely linked to high poverty rates in the United States. The interplay between obesity and poverty is rooted in various factors, including access to healthy foods, education levels, physical activity levels, and living environments. Lower-income communities often face greater challenges in accessing nutritious food options, contributing to higher rates of obesity. Moreover, our data analysis showed that these lower income communities often have limited access to safe spaces for physical activity, further compounding the issue of obesity in low income areas. We also wanted to analyze how the time has impacted the correlation between obesity and poverty. Taking to consideration of COVID-19, lockdowns and social distancing measures led to reduced physical activity and decrease in overall net income per family. Economic hardships intensified by the pandemic, especially in already low income communities, have made it much harder for people living in poverty to afford healthy food options or access fitness facilities. However, it looks like there was little to no correlation between time and obesity rates. State-by-State analysis also revealed that low physical activity rates are closely linked with higher obesity and poverty rates. States with lower socioeconomic status often report less access to recreational facilities, increasing the number of people per state who perform zero leisure physical activity. This relationship underscores the importance of public health strategies and policies that aim to increase physical activity levels across all socioeconomic levels.
                  
In conclusion, while this data provides valuable insights, it is important to note that it is not entirely comprehensive and may not accurately reflect the full extent of the causations of obesity in the United States. However, even with the data present here, it is easy to draw the conclusion that there is a very serious epidemic in the United States in regards to health, obesity, and poverty. The years of 2018-2022 have shed light on the intricate relationship between obesity and poverty, with the COVID-19 pandemic playing a significant role in exacerbating these issues. Although we have highlighted a correlation between poverty, obesity, and lack of physical activity, it's important to address that obesity is a highly complex issue that is multifaceted by American culture, diet fads, mental health, healthcare access, and much more. Public health interventions must be tailored to address the specific needs of dispared communities that aren't given equitable access to resources that promote healthy lifestyles and combat the cycle of obesity and poverty.
